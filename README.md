# ETH Mathematical Optmization Summary

Here you can find the explanations and definitions to summarize the content of the lecture about Mathematical Optimization - Prof. Dr. Robert Weismantel.

This course covers:
- Linear optimization: The geometry of linear programming, the simplex method for solving linear programming problems, Farkas' Lemma and infeasibility certificates, duality theory of linear programming.
- Nonlinear optimization: Lagrange relaxation techniques, Newton method and gradient schemes for convex optimization.
- Integer optimization: Ties between linear and integer optimization, total unimodularity, complexity theory, cutting plane theory.
- Combinatorial optimization: Network flow problems, structural results and algorithms for matroids, matchings and more generally, independence systems.

In this course, the lectures are only at the blackboard and concepts of linear algebra and analysis are prerequisites.
